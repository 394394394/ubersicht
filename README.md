# Ubersicht

Ubersicht is a lightweight, frontend only dashboard for all the public repos of any github organisation. It runs as a gh-page, so you can just fork this repo, change the `githubOrganisation`-variable in `main.js` and you've got your own public github dashboard.

It requires no API key and no data storage.

Yeah.

If this makes you happy or you'd like me to keep working on it, please let me know or possibly even [gittip me](https://www.gittip.com/espy).

Thanks!
